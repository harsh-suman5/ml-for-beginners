# Heart Disease Prediction

## Description
This project is a data science initiative focused on heart disease prediction using various machine learning techniques. It includes Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks for tutorials and analyses, datasets, and subfolders dedicated to specific topics like logistic regression and power plant data analysis.

## Contents
- **disease.py**: Python script demonstrating pandas operations on heart disease data, including series and dataframe manipulations.
- **analysis.py**: Script for plotting cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths related to smoking intensities using matplotlib.
- **requirements.txt**: List of Python dependencies required for the project (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, XGBoost, TensorFlow).
- **new.ipynb to new6.ipynb**: Jupyter notebooks for various analyses and experiments.
- **logistic regression/**: Subfolder containing notebooks on logistic regression, including basics and probability calibration curves.
- **CCPP/**: Subfolder with Combined Cycle Power Plant dataset, including data files (Folds5x2_pp.csv, .ods, .xlsx) and a readme explaining the dataset.
- **pandas --tutorials/**: Tutorials on pandas library.
- **tableau analysis/**: Tableau workbook for data visualization.
- **Datasets**:
  - heart_disease.csv: Primary dataset for heart disease prediction.
  - employees.csv: Employee-related data.
  - Stock data: ACC_minute.csv, ADANIPORTS_minute.csv, AMBUJACEM_minute.csv.
  - Tableau Dataset.csv: Dataset for Tableau analysis.
  - 3dplotting.png: Image file for 3D plotting.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python installed (preferably version 3.7 or higher).
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
- Run Python scripts directly: `python disease.py` or `python analysis.py`.
- Open Jupyter notebooks using Jupyter Lab or Notebook: `jupyter notebook` and navigate to the desired .ipynb file.
- For logistic regression analyses, explore the notebooks in the `logistic regression/` folder.
- Use Tableau to open `tableau analysis/Book1.twb` for visualizations.

## Datasets
- **heart_disease.csv**: Contains data for predicting heart disease, including features like age, gender, etc.
- **CCPP/Folds5x2_pp.csv**: Power plant data with ambient variables to predict electrical energy output.
- Other datasets as listed in Contents.
